## Algorithm:
UI AND UX DESIGN
LAB EXPERIMENT -2
a. Apply Gestalt Principles to Enhance Mobile and Web Layout Design
 Use Proximity by grouping related elements close together to help users quickly
associate connection and functionality.
 Apply Similarity by using consistent colors, shapes, and fonts for similar types
of content or controls, making navigation intuitive.
 Leverage Continuity to guide the user’s eye naturally across the layout, aligning
elements along paths that suggest flow and hierarchy.
 Utilize Closure by designing partial shapes or elements that the user’s brain
completes, enabling simplified visuals without clutter.
 Emphasize Figure-Ground contrast so that primary content stands out clearly
from the background and secondary information.
b. Incorporate UI Elements and Design Patterns into the Layouts
 Use Navigation bars, hamburger menus, and tab bars for clear and consistent
navigation across both mobile and web platforms.
 Include buttons, input fields, dropdowns, and sliders standardized by platform
conventions to enhance usability and familiarity.
 Embed cards and lists for content grouping that adapts well to responsive
layouts and touch interfaces.
 Integrate modals, tooltips, and accordions to manage information density
eAectively without overwhelming users.
 Follow established design patterns such as onboarding flows, error states, and
empty states with helpful instructions or illustrations.
 c. Develop Interaction Behaviors and Usability Principles
 Implement responsive touch targets that are large enough for f ingers on mobile
and clickable on desktops to improve accessibility.
 Ensure feedback on user actions such as button press animations, loading
indicators, and confirmation messages.
 Use progressive disclosure to hide advanced options and reveal them as
needed, reducing cognitive load.
 Provide keyboard and screen reader accessibility for inclusivity and usability
across diAerent user needs
.  Establish consistent interaction patterns across screens to reduce learning
time and build user confidence.
d. Create a Brand Logo Using Canva, Following Styling and Branding Guidelines
 In Canva, start with the brand color palette and typography chosen for the
brand identity.
 Use shapes and icons relevant to the brand message and industry (e.g.,
technology, creativity, trust).
 Keep the logo scalable and simple for use across all platforms, including web
and mobile layouts.  Export the logo in common formats (PNG, SVG) for easy
integration.
 Include the logo in the header or footer areas of the layouts to reinforce brand
presence consistently.
